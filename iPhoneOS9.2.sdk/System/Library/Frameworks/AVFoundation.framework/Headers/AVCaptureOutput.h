 @abstract
    AVCaptureOutput is an abstract class that defines an interface for an output destination of an AVCaptureSession.
 
 @discussion
    AVCaptureOutput provides an abstract interface for connecting capture output destinations, such as files and video
    previews, to an AVCaptureSession.

    An AVCaptureOutput can have multiple connections represented by AVCaptureConnection objects, one for each stream of
    media that it receives from an AVCaptureInput. An AVCaptureOutput does not have any connections when it is first
    created. When an output is added to an AVCaptureSession, connections are created that map media data from that
    session's inputs to its outputs.

    Concrete AVCaptureOutput instances can be added to an AVCaptureSession using the -[AVCaptureSession addOutput:] and
    -[AVCaptureSession addOutputWithNoConnections:] methods.

    AVMetadataObject bounds may be expressed as a rect where {0,0} represents the top left of the picture area,

    yaw and roll angles with respect to an unrotated picture.  -transformedMetadataObjectForMetadataObject:connection: 
	converts the visual properties in the coordinate space of the supplied AVMetadataObject to the coordinate space of 
    the receiver.  The conversion takes orientation, mirroring, and scaling into consideration.

    If an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput instance's connection's videoOrientation or videoMirrored properties are set to
    non-default values, the output applies the desired mirroring and orientation by physically rotating and or flipping 
    sample buffers as they pass through it.  AVCaptureStillImageOutput, on the other hand, does not physically rotate its buffers.
    It attaches an appropriate kCGImagePropertyOrientation number to captured still image buffers (see ImageIO/CGImageProperties.h)
    indicating how the image should be displayed on playback.  Likewise, AVCaptureMovieFileOutput does not physically
    apply orientation/mirroring to its sample buffers -- it uses a QuickTime track matrix to indicate how the buffers
    should be rotated and/or flipped on playback.

    A dispatch queue on which all sample buffer delegate methods will be called.

 @discussion
    When a new video sample buffer is captured it will be vended to the sample buffer delegate using the
    captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method. All delegate methods will be called on the
    specified dispatch queue. If the queue is blocked when new frames are captured, those frames will be automatically
    dropped at a time determined by the value of the alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames property. This allows clients to
    process existing frames on the same queue without having to manage the potential memory usage increases that would
    otherwise occur when that processing is unable to keep up with the rate of incoming frames. If their frame processing
    is consistently unable to keep up with the rate of incoming frames, clients should consider using the
    minFrameDuration property, which will generally yield better performance characteristics and more consistent frame
    rates than frame dropping alone.

    Clients that need to minimize the chances of frames being dropped should specify a queue on which a sufficiently
    small amount of processing is being done outside of receiving sample buffers. However, if such clients migrate extra
    processing to another queue, they are responsible for ensuring that memory usage does not grow without bound from
    frames that have not been processed.

    The method sets the file URL to which the receiver is currently writing output media. If a file at the given URL
    already exists when capturing starts, recording to the new file will fail.

    Clients need not call stopRecording before calling this method while another recording is in progress. On Mac OS X,

    When recording is stopped either by calling stopRecording, by changing files using this method, or because of an
    error, the remaining data that needs to be included to the file will be written in the background. Therefore, clients
    must specify a delegate that will be notified when all data has been written to the file using the

 @discussion
    In apps linked before Mac OS X 10.8, delegates that implement the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection:

    Mac OS X 10.8, delegates must implement captureOutputShouldProvideSampleAccurateRecordingStart: to indicate
    whether frame accurate start/stop recording is required (returning YES) or not (returning NO).
    The output calls this method as soon as the delegate is added, and never again.  If your delegate returns

 @param sampleBuffer
    A CMSampleBuffer object containing the sample data and additional information about the sample, such as its format
    and presentation time.
 @param connection
    The AVCaptureConnection object attached to the file output from which the sample data was received.

 @discussion
    This method is called whenever the file output receives a single sample buffer (a single video frame or audio buffer,
    for example) from the given connection. This gives delegates an opportunity to start and stop recording or change
    output files at an exact sample boundary if -captureOutputShouldProvideSampleAccurateRecordingStart: returns YES. 
    If called from within this method, the file output's startRecordingToOutputFileURL:recordingDelegate: and 
    resumeRecording methods are guaranteed to include the received sample buffer in the new file, whereas calls to 
    stopRecording and pauseRecording are guaranteed to include all samples leading up to those in the current sample 
    buffer in the existing file.

    Delegates can gather information particular to the samples by inspecting the CMSampleBuffer object. Sample buffers
    always contain a single frame of video if called from this method but may also contain multiple samples of audio. For
    B-frame video formats, samples are always delivered in presentation order.

    Clients that need to reference the CMSampleBuffer object outside of the scope of this method must CFRetain it and
    then CFRelease it when they are finished with it.

    Note that to maintain optimal performance, some sample buffers directly reference pools of memory that may need to be
    reused by the device system and other capture inputs. This is frequently the case for uncompressed device native
    capture where memory blocks are copied as little as possible. If multiple sample buffers reference such pools of
    memory for too long, inputs will no longer be able to copy new samples into memory and those samples will be dropped.
    If your application is causing samples to be dropped by retaining the provided CMSampleBuffer objects for too long,
    but it needs access to the sample data for a long period of time, consider copying the data into a new buffer and
    then calling CFRelease on the sample buffer if it was previously retained so that the memory it references can be
    reused. 
 
    Clients should not assume that this method will be called on a specific thread. In addition, this method is called
    periodically, so it must be efficient to prevent capture performance problems.

 @discussion
    When a recording is started the current state of a video capture connection's videoOrientation and videoMirrored
	properties are used to build the display matrix for the created video track. The movie file format allows only
	one display matrix per track, which means that any changes made during a recording to the videoOrientation and
	videoMirrored properties are not captured.  For example, a user starts a recording with their device in the portrait
	orientation, and then partway through the recording changes the device to a landscape orientation. The landscape
	orientation requires a different display matrix, but only the initial display matrix (the portrait display
	matrix) is recorded for the video track.
	
	By invoking this method the client application directs the movie file output to create an additional track in the
	captured movie. This track is a timed metadata track that is associated with the video track, and contains one or
	more samples that contain a Video Orientation value (as defined by EXIF and TIFF specifications, which is enumerated
	by CGImagePropertyOrientation in <ImageIO/CGImageProperties.h>).  The value represents the display matrix corresponding
	to the AVCaptureConnection's videoOrientation and videoMirrored properties when applied to the input source.  The
	initial sample written to the timed metadata track represents video track's display matrix. During recording additional
	samples will be written to the timed metadata track whenever the client application changes the video connection's
	videoOrienation or videoMirrored properties. Using the above example, when the client application detects the user
	changing the device from portrait to landscape orientation, it updates the video connection's videoOrientation property,
	thus causing the movie file output to add a new sample to the timed metadata track.
	
	After capture, playback and editing applications can use the timed metadata track to enhance their user's experience.
	For example, when playing back the captured movie, a playback engine can use the samples to adjust the display of the
	video samples to keep the video properly oriented.  Another example is an editing application that uses the sample
	the sample times to suggest cut points for breaking the captured movie into separate clips, where each clip is properly
	oriented.
	
	The default behavior is to not create the timed metadata track.
	
	The doRecordChanges value is only observed at the start of recording.  Changes to the value will not have any
	effect until the next recording is started.

    Instances of AVCaptureStillImageOutput can be used to capture, on demand, high quality snapshots from a realtime
    capture source. Clients can request a still image for the current time using the
    captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection:completionHandler: method. Clients can also configure still image
    outputs to produce still images in specific image formats.
