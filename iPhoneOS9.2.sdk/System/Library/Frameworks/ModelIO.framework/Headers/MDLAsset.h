 @class MDLAsset
 
 @abstract An MDLAsset represents the contents of a model file.
 
@discussion

 Each asset contains a collection of hierarchies of objects, where each object 
 in the asset is the top level of a hierarchy. Objects include transforms, 
 lights, cameras, and meshes.
 
 MDLAssets are typically instantiated from NSURLs that refer to a model resource.

 The model resource may represented timed information, for example, a series of 
 mesh morphs. If the asset is timed, then the framerate will be non-zero, and the 
 firstFrame and lastFrame properties will indicate the range for which sample 
 data exists. Samples before or after that range will be clamped. Some model 
 resource representations allow continuous sampling, others are discrete. In the 
 discrete case, if a requested sample time is not on a discrete boundary the 
 returned sample will be the sample exactly on the sample time, or if no such is 
 available, the immediately preceding sample. If no time is specified for a 
 sample, the first data will be returned.
 
 An asset's bounding box can be queried without traversing the hierarchy of 
 objects.
 
 Fast enumeration of an MDLAsset iterates the top level objects contained within.
