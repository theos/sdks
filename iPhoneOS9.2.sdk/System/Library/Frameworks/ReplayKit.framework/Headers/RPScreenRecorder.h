//  RPScreenRecorder.h
//  ReplayKit
//
//  ReplayKit is a high level framework that can be used to add video and audio recording capabilities to an application. An application supplied user interface can use the RPScreenRecorder singleton to start and stop recording. Once recording is finished, the framework will vend an instance of RPPreviewViewController that can be presented using [UIViewController presentViewController:animated:completion:]. The view controller allows the user to preview, trim and share the movie.
