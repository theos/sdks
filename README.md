# theos/sdks
This repository contains patched iOS SDKs containing private symbols. These were removed from official SDKs starting in Xcode 7.3 and the iOS 9.3 SDK.

To get older SDKs, you can "Show Package Contents" of the appropriate Xcode version, and then browse to `Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs`.

To use with Theos, [download this repo](https://github.com/theos/sdks/archive/master.zip), extract, and copy whichever SDKs you desire into `$THEOS/sdks/`.

Generated using [create_patched_sdk.sh](create_patched_sdk.sh) and inoahdevâ€™s [tbd v2.2](https://github.com/inoahdev/tbd/releases/tag/2.2) using binaries retrieved from iOS Device Support directory.
