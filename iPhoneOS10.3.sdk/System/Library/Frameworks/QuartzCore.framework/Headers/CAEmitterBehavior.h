/* `wave': Adds a force vector to each particle, modulating the
 * force value by a time-based wave function.
 *
 * CAPoint3D force: force vector [X Y Z].
 *
 * CGFloat frequency: oscillation frequency. The actual modulation
 * value is a triangular wave of the specified frequency composed with
 * a quadratic smoothstep function. */

/* `drag': Adds a constant drag force to each particle.
 *
 * CGFloat drag: slowing amount, the force on the particle is
 * calculated as "V * -drag" where "V" is the particle's current
 * velocity. */

/* `alignToMotion': Aligns the particle image's Y axis to its velocity
 * vector.
 *
 * CGFloat rotation: angle in rotations to apply in addition to
 * orientation of the velocity vector.
 *
 * BOOL preservesDepth: if true will operate in 3D, i.e. by picking
 * an axis orthogonal to the required rotation. If false (the default)
 * operates in 2D by rotating about the Z axis. Note that only `plane'
 * type particles support a 3D orientation. */

 * their current time.
 *
 * NSString *keyPath: name of the property to change.
 * NSArray<NSNumber> *values: array of numeric values.
 * NSArray<NSNumber> *locations: optional array of stop-locations.
 *
 * The particles current time is divided by its lifetime to give a
 * value in the [0,1] range, which is then interpolated into the values
 * array. The property is then replaced by the color from the gradient.
 *
 * Supported property names include: `position.x', `position.y',
 * `position.z', `velocity.x', `velocity.y', `velocity.z', `mass',
 * `rotation', `spin', scale', `scaleSpeed', `color.red',
 * `color.green', `color.blue', `color.alpha'. */

 * The particles current time is divided by its lifetime to give a

 * NSNumber falloff, falloffDistance: falloff values.
 * NSNumber spot: if true, light is a spot-light.
 * NSNumber appliesAlpha: if true, lit object's alpha is also affected.

 * For spot-lights:
 *   NSNumber directionLatitude, directionLongitude: the light's direction.
