// WKInterfacePicker is a UI component that presents items in a number of
// different styles for picking via the Digital Crown. These styles include:
//
// 1. List
// Items are shown in a vertically stacked list, similar to the UI shown during
// Activity Setup and Complication editing. Turning the Digital Crown moves up
// and down through the list.
//
// 2. Stack
// Items are shown as a stack of cards and can be flipped through via the crown.
//
// 3. Image Sequence
// Items are shown as a sequence of images, and turning the crown changes the
// visible image. Sequences of images can include animations, segments of a
// progress ring etc.
//
// Multiple pickers can be shown in a single Interface Controller, and they
// can be nested within a scrolling view.

// useful in cases where there are multiple on-screen pickers, or if the picker
// is nested in a scrollable view.
