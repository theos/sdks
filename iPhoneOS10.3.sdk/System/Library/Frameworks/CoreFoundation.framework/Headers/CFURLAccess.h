        CFURLAccess is deprecated as of Mac OS X 10.9 and iOS 7.0. The suggested replacement for URLs with network schemes (http, https, ftp, data) are the NSURLSession or NSURLConnection classes. The suggested replacement for URLs with the file scheme are the foundation classes NSFileManager, NSFileHandle and NSURL, or the CoreFoundation classes CFStream and CFURL.

/* Attempts to read the data and properties for the given URL.  If
only interested in one of the resourceData and properties, pass NULL
for the other.  If properties is non-NULL and desiredProperties is
NULL, then all properties are fetched.  Returns success or failure;
note that as much work as possible is done even if false is returned.
So for instance if one property is not available, the others are
fetched anyway. errorCode is set to 0 on success, and some other
value on failure.  If non-NULL, it is the caller 's responsibility
to release resourceData and properties.

    Apple reserves for its use all negative error code values; these
values represent errors common to any scheme.  Scheme-specific error
codes should be positive, non-zero, and should be used only if one of
the predefined Apple error codes does not apply.  Error codes should
be publicized and documented with the scheme-specific properties.

NOTE: When asking for the resource data, this call will allocate the entire
resource in memory. This can be very expensive, depending on the size of the
resource (file). Please use CFStream or other techniques if you are downloading
large files.
