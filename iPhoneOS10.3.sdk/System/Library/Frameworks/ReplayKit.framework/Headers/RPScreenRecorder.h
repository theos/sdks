//
//  RPScreenRecorder.h
//  ReplayKit
//
//  ReplayKit is a high level framework that can be used to add video and audio recording and broadcast capabilities to an application. An application supplied user interface can use the RPScreenRecorder singleton to start and stop recording or broadcasting.
//
//  Optionally the framework allows the user to also record microphone content as well as content from the front facing camera.
//
//  When local recording stops, the framework will vend an instance of RPPreviewViewController that can be presented using [UIViewController presentViewController:animated:completion:]. The view controller allows the user to preview, trim and share the movie.
//
//  When broadcasting stops, the framework will return a url that can be used to view a broadcast.
