/*!
 *  This method attempts to apply the MPSKernel in place on a texture.
 *
 *          In-place operation means that the same texture is used both to hold the input
 *          image and the results. Operating in-place can be an excellent way to reduce
 *          resource utilization, and save time and energy. While simple Metal kernels can
 *          not operate in place because textures can not be readable and writable at the
 *          same time, some MPSKernels can operate in place because they use
 *          multi-pass algorithms. Whether a MPSKernel can operate in-place can
 *          depend on current hardware, operating system revision and the parameters
 *          and properties passed to it. You should never assume that a MPSKernel will
 *          continue to work in place, even if you have observed it doing so before.
 *
 *  If the operation succeeds in-place, YES is returned.  If the in-place operation
 *  fails and no copyAllocator is provided, then NO is returned. Without a fallback
 *  MPSCopyAllocator, in neither case is the pointer held at *texture modified.
 *
 *  Failure during in-place operation is very common and will occur inconsistently across
 *  different hardware platforms and OS releases. Without a fallback MPSCopyAllocator,
 *  operating in place may require significant error handling code to accompany each
 *  call to -encodeToCommandBuffer:..., complicating your code.
 *
 *  You may find it simplifies your code to provide a fallback MPSCopyAllocator so
 *  that the operation can proceed reliably even when it can not proceed in-place.
 *  When an in-place filter fails, the MPSCopyAllocator (if any) will be
 *  invoked to create a new texture in which to write the results, allowing the
 *  filter to proceed reliably out-of-place. The original texture will be released,
 *  replaced with a pointer to the new texture and YES will be returned. If the
 *  allocator returns an invalid texture, it is released, *texture remains unmodified
 *  and NO is returned.  Please see the MPSCopyAllocator definition for a sample allocator
 *  implementation.
 *
 *  Sample usage with a copy allocator:
 *  @code
 *  id <MTLTexture> inPlaceTex = ...;
 *  MPSImageSobel *sobelFiler = [[MPSImageSobel alloc] initWithDevice: my_device];
 *
 *  // With a fallback MPSCopyAllocator, failure should only occur in exceptional
 *  // conditions such as MTLTexture allocation failure or programmer error.
 *  // That is, the operation is roughly as robust as the MPSCopyAllocator.
 *  // Depending on the quality of that, we might decide we are justified here
 *  // in not checking the return value.
 *  [sobelFilter encodeToCommandBuffer: my_command_buffer
 *                      inPlaceTexture: &inPlaceTex  // may be replaced!
 *               fallbackCopyAllocator: myAllocator];
 *
 *  // If myAllocator was not called:
 *  //
 *  //      inPlaceTex holds the original texture with the result pixels in it
 *  //
 *  // else,
 *  //
 *  //      1) myAllocator creates a new texture.
 *  //      2) The new texture pixel data is overwritten by MPSUnaryImageKernel.
 *  //      3) The old texture passed in *inPlaceTex is released once.
 *  //      4) *inPlaceTex = the new texture
 *  //
 *  // In either case, the caller should now hold one reference to the texture now held in
 *  // inPlaceTex, whether it was replaced or not. Most of the time that means that nothing
 *  // further needs to be done here, and you can proceed to the next image encoding operation.
 *  // However, if other agents held references to the original texture, they still hold them
 *  // and may need to be alerted that the texture has been replaced so that they can retain
 *  // the new texture and release the old one.
 *
 *  [sobelFilter release];  // if not ARC, clean up the MPSImageSobel object
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Note: Image filters that look at neighboring pixel values may actually consume more
 *        memory when operating in place than out of place. Many such operations are
 *        tiled internally to save intermediate texture storage, but can not tile when
 *        operating in place. The memory savings for tiling is however very short term,
 *        typically the lifetime of the MTLCommandBuffer.

 *      Caution: This function operates using global image coordinates, but
 *      -encodeToCommandBuffer:... uses coordinates local to the source and
 *      destination image textures. Consequently, the secondaryOffset and clipRect
 *      attached to this object will need to be updated using a global to
 *      local coordinate transform before -encodeToCommandBuffer:... is
 *      called.
 *
 *  @abstract   Determine the region of the source texture that will be read for a encode operation
 *  @param      destinationSize     The size of the full virtual destination image.
 *  @return     The area in the virtual source image that will be read.
