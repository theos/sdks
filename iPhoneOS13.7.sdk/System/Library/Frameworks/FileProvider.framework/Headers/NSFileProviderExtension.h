     to a new device.

     2. Two directories are merged together. Each child resulting of the merge
     may be recreated with the .mayAlreadyExists option. This allows the
     extension to recursively merge directories.

     The Extension should assess whether the item could actually be a disk
     representation of an already existing item.

     Since this can happens when the system has to reimport all the existing
     item from disk, it is advised that the assessment method avoids
     computational intensive tasks, such as checksumming the item.

@interface NSFileProviderExtension (CreateItem)

/**
 Create a new item.

 This is expected to complete before doing any network.

 The itemTemplate object describes the expected state of the newly created item,
 including its location provided by parentItemIdentifier and filename. The list
 of fields to conside in that object is defined by the fields parameter. Fields
 not listed should be considered as not being defined.

 The itemIdentifier of \the itemTemplate should not be accessed and is actual
 value is not defined. Importing the item should assign a unique itemIdentifier
 to the newly imported item.

 In the completion block, the createdItem is expected to have its properties
 matching the values of the item properties with the exception of the
 itemIdentifier that should be a newly allocated identifier.

 If the item is a document, the contents should be fetched from provided
 URL. Otherwise url will be nil. In case the NSFileProviderCreateItemOptionsItemMayAlreadyExist
 is passed, the content may be nil if the item is found by the system without any
 associated content. In that case, you should return a nil item if you are not
 able to match the imported item with existing items from the provider.

 The provider can indicates it has merged the new item into an existing one by
 returning an item with the identifier of the existing one. Only merging directories
 is supported.

 Note that the itemIdentifier on the returned item should be assigned without a
 network call.  It doesn't have to be the final identifier.  If the identifier
 changes after talking to the server then the file provider should send a delete
 for the temporary, local identifier immediately followed by an add with the
 final identifier.

 This is expected to work offline even if there might be a collision (two items
 are at the same location) only detected when later syncing up this change to
 the server.  In that case, it is suggested that a follow up update to the item
 change its filename to something unique.  This wouldn't be considered an error
 to import.

 If the imported item is refused by the extension, it should return nil for the
 createdItem without any error. In that case, the source item will be deleted
 from disk. If the extension does not wish to synchronise the item, while still
 keeping it on disk, it should still import it locally, but not sync it to its
 server, and return a valid createItem object.

 If however you can tell right away, with no communication to your server, that
 there is a collision then this call should fail with error code
 NSFileProviderErrorFilenameCollision generated with this method:
 -[NSError (NSFileProviderError) fileProviderErrorForCollisionWithItem:].

 The existing item set in this error will be used to handle the collision, and
 ask the user if she or he would like to replace the existing item.  This takes
 into account the existing item's capabilities (particularly
 NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsTrashing and AllowsDeleting.)

 Upload errors (such as NSFileProviderErrorInsufficientQuota) should be handled
 with a subsequent update to the item, setting its uploadingError property.
 Upload errors should not prevent creating or importing a document, because they
 can be resolved at a later date (for example, when the user has quota again.)

 Other errors will be presented to the user, but are unexpected.  If you want to
 prevent imports in a given directory, then the directory item's capacities
 should exclude NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsAddingSubItems.
