 The item identifier of the working set, a synthetic container used by the
 extension to communicate changes to the system even when the parent directories
 of these items aren't actively being enumerated.  Items in this set should have
 their parentItemIdentifier set to the identifier of their parent directory.

 The working set is the set of files and directories that should be made
 available to the system regardless of the local browsing history.  Files listed
 in the working set are indexed in the local Spotlight index and appear in
 offline search results.  They contribute to the Recents view of the Files app,
 sorted by lastUsedDate, and it is therefore important to provide a consistent
 experience across devices by including in the working set all the documents
 recently used, trashed, favorited, shared or tagged.

 The Spotlight index and the Recents view will show outdated information unless
 the file provider extension keeps the working set up to date with local and
 remote changes.  When an item in the working set is remotely modified, the
 extension calls -signalEnumeratorForContainerItemIdentifier: on the identifier
 of the working set; the system will then enumerate changes and update its caches.

 Starting in iOS 12 and macOS 10.15, the system maintains a cache on the local
 file system of files and directories previously enumerated.  The working set
 is the container used to update that set of files.  The extension may know
 whether an item is in that set by checking whether its parentItemIdentifier
 is listed in the materialized containers, see the documentation on
 -materializedItemsDidChangeWithCompletionHandler:.

 Syncable extended attributes on the file.

 The system decides which extended attributes should be synced from the device,
 based on a set of rules largely inferred from the name of the extended
 attribute.  Extended attributes named with xattr_name_with_flags(XATTR_FLAG_SYNCABLE)
 will be listed in this dictionary; some extended attributes introduced before
 this API are also whitelisted for sync.

 Syncable xattrs are capped in size to about 32KiB total for a given item.
 When the set of extended attributes on a file is larger than that, the system
 demotes some of the extended attributes to non-syncable.

 The system decides which non-syncable extended attributes should be preserved
 locally when the item is updated remotely, based on a set of rules again largely
 inferred from the name of the extended attribute.  Extended attributes named
 with xattr_name_with_flags(XATTR_FLAG_CONTENT_DEPENDENT) will be preserved only
 if itemVersion.contentVersion was not modified by the remote update.

 Some NSFileProviderItem properties (lastUsedDate, tagData...) happen to be
 stored on disk in extended attributes that won't be listed in this dictionary
 because that would be redundant.  The 32 bits of Finder info in the extended
 attribute named XATTR_FINDERINFO_NAME ("com.apple.FinderInfo") is not listed
 here for the same reason: the syncable Finder info bits are deserialized to
 other properties of NSFileProviderItem.

 The system will set extended attributes on dataless files, and will preserve
 them when a file is rendered dataless.  I.e extended attributes are considered
 metadata, not content.  The resource fork however is considered content and
 will not be included in this dictionary.  Local changes to the resource fork
 will be communicated under NSFileProviderItemFieldContents.  Remote changes to
 the resource fork should bump itemVersion.contentVersion.

    - `SubInteractions `: *dictionary* (same as `NSFileProviderUserInteractions`)

 For each interaction, either Alert or SubInteractions must be specified. SubInteractions will be evaluated if the main ActivationRule evaluates to
 YES for at least once. This allows you to match a general pattern via the top-level activation rule and then select a specialized error message from a list
 of subpatterns.
