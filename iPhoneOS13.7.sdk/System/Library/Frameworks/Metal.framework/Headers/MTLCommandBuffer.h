 The command buffer has not been enqueued yet.

 This command buffer is enqueued, but not committed.

 Commited to its command queue, but not yet scheduled for execution.

 All dependencies have been resolved and the command buffer has been scheduled for execution.

 The command buffer has finished executing successfully: any blocks set with -addCompletedHandler: may now be called.

 Execution of the command buffer was aborted due to an error during execution.  Check -error for more information.

 An internal error that doesn't fit into the other categories. The actual low level error code is encoded in the local description.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorTimeout
 Execution of this command buffer took too long, execution of this command was interrupted and aborted.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorPageFault
 Execution of this command buffer generated an unserviceable GPU page fault. This can caused by buffer read write attribute mismatch or out of boundary access.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorBlacklisted
 Access to this device has been revoked because this client has been responsible for too many timeouts or hangs.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorNotPermitted
 This process does not have access to use this device.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorOutOfMemory
 Insufficient memory was available to execute this command buffer.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorInvalidResource
 The command buffer referenced an invalid resource.  This is most commonly caused when the caller deletes a resource before executing a command buffer that refers to it.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorMemoryless
 One or more internal resources limits reached that prevent using memoryless render pass attachments. See error string for more detail.
 
 @constant MTLCommandBufferErrorDeviceRemoved
 The device was physically removed before the command could finish execution
