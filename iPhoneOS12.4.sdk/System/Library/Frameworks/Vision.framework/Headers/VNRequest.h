@discussion VNRequest objects are instantiated in a pre-configured nominal state. Prior to sending a VNRequest to a request handler to perform a desired operation, the default configuration can be changed by modifying the values of VNRequest properties. The VNRequest class itself acts as a base class and is not meant to be directly instantiated.
