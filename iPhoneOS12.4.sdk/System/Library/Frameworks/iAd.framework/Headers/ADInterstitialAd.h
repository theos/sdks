/*!
 * ADInterstitialAd is a full screen advertisement, available on iPad since
 * iOS 4.3, and on iPhone since iOS 7.0.
 *
 * There are three ways to display an ADInterstitialAd:
 *
 *   • By providing a container view and calling -presentInView:
 *   • By providing a view controller and calling -presentFromViewController:
 *   • Indirectly, by setting the interstitial presentation policy on a view
 *     controller to Automatic or Manual (via -[UIViewController setInterstitialPresentationPolicy:]),
 *     and letting the framework manage presentation.
 *
 * An ADInterstitialAd should not be presented until it has loaded content. This
 * is indicated via the -interstitialAdDidLoad: delegate method, and can also be
 * queried via the loaded property. If the interstitial ad is presented when
 * loaded=NO, an exception will be thrown.
 *
 * Note that using interstitial ads on iPhones running iOS < 7.0 will cause an
 * exception to be thrown.
