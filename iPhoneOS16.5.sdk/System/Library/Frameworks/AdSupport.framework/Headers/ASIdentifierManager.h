/// The UUID that is specific to a device.
///
/// The ``ASIdentifierManager/advertisingIdentifier`` is an alphanumeric string
/// that’s unique to each device, and which you only use for advertising. Use
/// this string for frequency capping, attribution, conversion events,
/// estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and
/// debugging. On devices running iOS 14.5 and later and iPadOS 14.5 and later,
/// your app must request tracking authorization before it can get the
/// advertising identifier. For more information on getting the advertising
/// identifier, see ``AdSupport``.
///
/// The advertising identifier returns either a unique UUID, or all zeros. It
/// returns a unique UUID in the following cases:
///
/// - If Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking &gt; Allow Apps to Request to Track
/// is On, you’ve requested tracking authorization from the user by calling the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency> APIs,
/// and received authorization, indicated by
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanagerauthorizationstatus/attrackingmanagerauthorizationstatusauthorized>.
/// - If the user changes Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking &gt; Allow Apps to
/// Request to Track to Off after authorizing your app, and leaves the
/// permissions On for your app.
///
/// The advertising identifier returns all zeros
/// (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) in the following cases:
///
/// - In Simulator, regardless of any settings. - When you call this API on a
/// device running macOS. - On devices running iOS 14.5 and later and iPadOS
/// 14.5 and later,
///
///    if you haven’t requested authorization using the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency> framework. - If you’ve requested authorization using the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency> framework and the user declines, which results in an authorization status of <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanagerauthorizationstatus/attrackingmanagerauthorizationstatusdenied>. - When a profile or configuration restricts access to the advertising identifier. For more information about restrictions, see <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanagerauthorizationstatus/attrackingmanagerauthorizationstatusrestricted>.
///
/// As a best practice, don’t store the advertising identifier value; access
/// ``ASIdentifierManager/advertisingIdentifier`` instead. Users can change
/// their authorization for tracking at any time in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt;
/// Tracking. Check your app’s authorization using the App Tracking Transparency
/// API
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/3547038-trackingauthorizationstatus>
