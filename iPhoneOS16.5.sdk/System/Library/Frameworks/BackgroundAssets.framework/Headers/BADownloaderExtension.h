@protocol BADownloaderExtension <NSObject>

@optional

/*!
 @abstract Invoked by the system when the extension should check for updated content.
 @discussion This method will be invoked by the system upon requested events defined in `BAContentRequest`.
 This method should return a set of all `BAURLDownload`'s that your extension would like to schedule.
 During the invocation of this method, `BADownloadManager` will prohibit the ability to schedule additional downloads
 until this method exits scope. Therefore, all downloads needing to be scheduled should be returned here.
 If a download fails, it can be rescheduled using `BADownloadManager` in any other method in this protocol.
 @param contentRequest The content request event that occured that caused this method to be invoked.
 @param manifestURL A file URL to the local manifest that was pre-downloaded and specified in your App's Info.plist under the `BAManifestURL`.
 The file is read-only and will be deleted after this method returns. If you wish to keep it, you must copy it out.
 @param extensionInfo Information about your extension that may be useful for making a decision about
 what content needs to be scheduled.
 @result A set of unique `BAURLDownload` objects that the extension should schedule for download.
 @warning You cannot use `BADownloadManager` to manually schedule downloads using this method. All downloads to enqueue must be returned.
