 Initializes a point of interest to be used with @c CPPointOfInterestTemplate .

 @param location Location indicator use by map annotations.
 @param title Primary title for this point of interest.

 @param summary Optional: Summary text for this point of interest.
 @param detailTitle Optional: Title to be used when POI detail card is visible.
 @param detailSubtitle Optional: Subtitle to be used when POI detail card is visible.
 @param detailSummary Optional: Summary text to be used when POI detail card is visible.
 @param pinImage Optional: a custom unselected map annotation image.
 @param selectedPinImage Optional: a custom selected map annotation image.
 
 @note When providing an image, your app should provide a @c UIImage that is display-ready. If necessary for the image, provide
 light and dark styles by using an asset from your asset catalog, prepared with light and dark styles
 or by using @c UIImageAsset to combine two @c UIImage instances into a single image with
 both styles.
 
 CPPointOfInterest instances appear on the Point of Interest map view as both selectable items in the table view overlay and as map annotations.
 
 @discussion To properly size your pin images, your app should size them to the display scale of the car screen. See -[CPInterfaceController carTraitCollection].
