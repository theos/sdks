  @class        AVPlayerInterstitialEvent

  @abstract
    An AVPlayerInterstitialEvent provides instructions for temporarily suspending the playback of primary content in order to play alternative interstitial content instead, resuming playback of the primary content when playback of the interstitial content is complete or is canceled.
    
  @discussion
    The primary content is specified as an instance of AVPlayerItem, designated as the primary item of the interstitial event.

    The timing of interstitial playback is specified as a date within the date range of the primary item. Interstitial events are currently possible only for items with an intrinsic mapping from their timeline to real-time dates.

    The alternative interstitial content is specified as an array of one or more AVPlayerItems that will be used as templates for the creation of items for interstitial playback. In other words, these template items are not the actual items that will be played during interstitial playback; instead they are used to generate the items that are to be played, with property values that match the configuration of your template items.

    If you wish to observe the scheduling and progress of interstitial events, use an AVPlayerInterstitialEventMonitor. If you wish to specify your own schedule of interstitial events, use an AVPlayerInterstitialEventController.

	Note that while previously AVPlayerInterstitialEvent was an immutable object, it is now mutable. This allows it to be created and customized before being set on an AVPlayerInterstitialEventController.

For each AVPlayerInterstitialEvent, when the primary player's current item is the primary item of the interstitial event and its currentDate reaches the date of the event, playback of the primary item by the primary player is temporarily suspended, i.e. its timeControlStatus changes to AVPlayerTimeControlStatusWaitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate and its reasonForWaitingToPlay will change to AVPlayerWaitingDuringInterstitialEventReason. During this suspension, playback of items that replicate the interstitial template items of the event are played by the interstitial player, which temporarily assumes the output configuration of the primary player; for example, its visual content will be routed to AVPlayerLayers that reference the primary player. Once the interstitial player has advanced through playback of the interstitial items specified by the event or its current item otherwise becomes nil, playback of the primary content will resume, at an offset from the time at which it was suspended as specified by the event.

  @discussion
    Setting this property to a non-nil value cancels and overrides all previously scheduled future interstitial events, including those that are intrinsically specified by the content of primary items, such as directives carried by HLS media playlists. Setting it to nil causes its value to be reset in accordance with the content of the current primary item.

    If you change the value of events during an interstitial event and the current event is not included in the new value of events, the current event is nevertheless allowed to continue until completion. If you wish to cancel the current event, use -cancelCurrentEventWithResumptionOffset:.

    If interstitial events are scheduled with dates that coincide either with the date of another scheduled interstitial event or with the date range of the primary content that's omitted according to the resumption offset of another scheduled interstitial event, the primary content will remain suspended until all coinciding interstitial events have been completed. The effective resumption offset will be the sum of the resumption offsets of the coinciding interstitial events. (Note that the sum of a numeric CMTime and kCMTimeIndefinite is kCMTimeIndefinite.)

    If interstitial events are scheduled for the same date, they are ordered according to their position in the events array.

    The receiver will make a copy of the events that are set on it. Subsequent mutations on the original events will have no effect on the copy.
    
    An NSInvalidArgumentException will be raised if an under-specified AVPlayerInterstitialEvent is set, such as one with a nil primaryItem, or with neither a time nor a date.
