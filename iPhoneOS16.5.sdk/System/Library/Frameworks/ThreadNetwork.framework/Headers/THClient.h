/// A class that supports safely sharing Thread credentials between multiple
/// clients.
///
/// Request credentials for either a specific Thread network or for the
/// _preferred network_ using `THClient`. The preferred network is the default
/// Thread network chosen by the framework for a home.
///
/// The ThreadNetwork framework maintains a database of network credentials. The
/// class allows clients to store, list, and delete credentials for a given
/// network from the database.
///
/// Some methods in `THClient` use the _team ID_, a string that you store in
/// your application’s `Info.plist`. The ThreadNetwork framework uses the team
/// ID to preserve the privacy of the Thread network credentials across
/// different clients. For example, credentials stored by one client can’t be
/// deleted or modified by another client.
///
/// - Important: Thread credentials give you the ability to add any device into
///   the Thread network. Use this information responsibly.
