/// A service that you use to validate the instance of your app running on a
/// device.
///
/// Use the ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/sharedService`` instance of the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService`` class to assert the legitimacy of a
/// particular instance of your app to your server. After ensuring service
/// availability by reading the ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/supported``
/// property, you use the service to:
///
/// - Create a cryptographic key in the Secure Enclave by calling the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/generateKeyWithCompletionHandler:`` method.
/// - Ask Apple to certify the key by calling the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/attestKey:clientDataHash:completionHandler:``
/// method. - Prepare an assertion of your app’s integrity to accompany any or
/// all server requests using the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/generateAssertion:clientDataHash:completionHandler:``
/// method.
///
/// For more information about how to support App Attest in your app, see

/// complementary procedures you implement on your server, see
/// <doc:validating-apps-that-connect-to-your-server>.

/// Call this method to request the creation of a secure, unattested key pair on
/// a device for a specific user. On success, the method provides your app with
/// an identifier that represents the key pair stored in the Secure Enclave.
/// Because there’s no way to use or retrieve the key without the identifier,
/// you’ll want to either record it in your app or on your server right away. If
/// key generation fails, the closure provides a ``DeviceCheck/DCError-swift.struct`` that
/// indicates the reason for the failure.
///
/// Create a unique key for each user account on a device. Otherwise it’s hard
/// to detect an attack that uses a single compromised device to serve multiple
/// remote users running a compromised version of your app. For more
/// information, see <doc:assessing-fraud-risk>.
///
/// After you get the identifier, you call the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/attestKey:clientDataHash:completionHandler:``
/// method with the key identifier to ask Apple to attest to the validity of the
/// associated key. Later, you call the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/generateAssertion:clientDataHash:completionHandler:``
/// method with the key identifier to answer a challenge from your server, and
/// establish the legitimacy of this instance of your app.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - completionHandler: A closure that the method calls upon completion with
/// the following parameters:
///   - keyId:  An identifier that you use to refer to the key. The framework securely
/// stores the key in the Secure Enclave.
///   - error:  A ``DeviceCheck/DCError-swift.struct`` instance that indicates the
/// reason for failure, or `nil` on success.

/// Asks Apple to attest to the validity of a generated cryptographic key.
///
/// This method asks Apple to attest to the validity of a key that you
/// previously generated with a call to the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/generateKeyWithCompletionHandler:`` method.
/// Provide the method with both the key identifier and a computed hash of a
/// data block that includes a one-time challenge from your server to prevent
/// replay attacks. For example, you can use CryptoKit to create a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/cryptokit/sha256> hash of
/// challenge data:
///
/// ```swift
/// import CryptoKit let hash = Data(SHA256.hash(data: challenge)) // A
/// challenge from your server.
/// ```
/// The attest method calls its completion handler to return an attestation
/// object to you, which you must send to your server for verification. A
/// compromised version of your app could falsify the verification result, thus
/// circumventing App Attest.
///
/// If you successfully verify the attestation object on your server, as
/// described in <doc:validating-apps-that-connect-to-your-server>, then you can
/// associate the key identifier with the user on the device for future
/// reference. You’ll need the identifier to generate assertions with calls to
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/generateAssertion:clientDataHash:completionHandler:``.
/// If your server fails to verify the attestation object, discard the key
/// identifier.
///
/// If the method’s completion handler returns the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCError-swift.struct/serverUnavailable`` error — typically due to network
/// connectivity issues — it means that the framework failed to reach the App
/// Attest service to complete the attestation. In this case, retry attestation
/// again using the same key and client data hash later to avoid unnecessarily
/// generating new keys. Retrying with the same inputs helps to preserve the
/// risk metric for a given device.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - keyId: The identifier you received when generating a cryptographic key by
/// calling the
/// ``DeviceCheck/DCAppAttestService/generateKeyWithCompletionHandler:`` method.
///   - clientDataHash: A SHA256 hash of a unique, single-use data block that
/// embeds a challenge from your server.
///   - completionHandler: A closure that the method calls upon completion with
/// the following parameters:
///   - attestationObject: A statement from Apple about the validity of the key
/// associated with `keyId`. Send this to your server for processing. - term
///   - error: A ``DeviceCheck/DCError-swift.struct`` instance that indicates the reason for
/// failure, or `nil` on success.

///
/// You provide the key identifier and a hash of the request that includes a
