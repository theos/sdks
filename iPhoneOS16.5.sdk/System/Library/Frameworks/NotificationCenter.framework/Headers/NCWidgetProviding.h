// If the widget has local state that can be loaded quickly, it should do so before returning from ‘viewWillAppear:’.
// Otherwise, the widget should ensure that the state and layout of its view when returning from 'viewWillAppear:’ will match that of the last time it returned from 'viewWillDisappear:', transitioning smoothly to the new data later when it arrives.”

// While the Notification Center ultimately controls the layout of its children, widgets can request a change in height.
// Widgets with heights defined by constraints will be automatically adjusted (within limits).
// Widgets using explicit layout can request a new height (that may, or may not, be adjusted or honored at all) by changing the value of their ‘preferredContentSize’.
// Should either form of request result in a height change, the widget will be messaged with ‘viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator:’ and, if the transition is animated, passed a transition coordinator.
// If the transition coordinator argument is not 'nil', and the widget has additional animations it wishes to run in concert with the height change, it can specify them and/or a completion block by messaging the coordinator with 'animateAlongsideTransition:completion:'.

// If implemented, the system will call at opportune times for the widget to update its state, both when the Notification Center is visible as well as in the background.

// Widgets should call the argument block when the work is complete, passing the appropriate 'NCUpdateResult'.
// Widgets should NOT block returning from 'viewWillAppear:' on the results of this operation.
// Instead, widgets should load cached state in 'viewWillAppear:' in order to match the state of the view from the last 'viewWillDisappear:', then transition smoothly to the new data when it arrives.
