 The input reporting axis values as the change (delta) since the last event.
 
 Certain kinds of axis elements are only able to report relative values.  The
 tracking of a computer mouse, for example, has no fixed origin - only the
 change in position since the last event is reported.  Some freely-rotating
 dials may also only report a value indicating which direction the dial was
 turned.
