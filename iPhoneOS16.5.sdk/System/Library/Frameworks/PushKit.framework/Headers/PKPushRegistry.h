/// An object that requests the delivery and handles the receipt of PushKit notifications.
///
/// A `PKPushRegistry` object manages only certain types of notifications,
/// such as high-priority notifications needed by a VoIP app. PushKit wakes up your app
/// as needed to deliver incoming notifications and delivers the notifications directly
/// to the push registry object that requested them.
///
/// Every time your app launches, whether in the foreground or in the background, create
/// a push registry object and configure it. Typically, you keep the push registry object
/// running for the duration of your app. Each push registry object delivers incoming
/// notifications to its ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/delegate`` object, which also handles
/// the responses for registration requests. The listing below shows how to create
/// a push registry object and request VoIP notifications. Always assign an appropriate
/// delegate object before modifying the ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/desiredPushTypes``
/// property.
///
/// ```objc
/// - (void) registerForVoIPPushes {
///    self.voipRegistry = [[PKPushRegistry alloc] initWithQueue:nil];
///    self.voipRegistry.delegate = self;
///
///    // Initiate registration.
///    self.voipRegistry.desiredPushTypes = [NSSet setWithObject:PKPushTypeVoIP];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Assigning a new value to the ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/desiredPushTypes`` property
/// registers the push registry object with the PushKit servers. The server reports the
/// success or failure of your registration attempts asynchronously to the push registry,
/// which then reports those results to its delegate object. The push registry also delivers
/// all received notifications to the delegate object. For more information about the
/// delegate methods, see ``PushKit/PKPushRegistryDelegate``.

///
/// When linking against the iOS 13 SDK or later, your implementation of this method
